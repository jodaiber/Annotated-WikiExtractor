'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] which considers the [[state (polity)|state]] undesirable, unnecessary and harmful, and instead promotes a stateless society, or [[anarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;

To individualize spiritual wealth.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html [[Renzo Novatore]]. ''Toward the Creative Nothing'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

Differing fundamentally, some [[anarchist schools of thought]] support anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;  In the end, for anarchist historian [[Daniel Guerin]] &quot;Some anarchists are more [[Individualistic anarchism|individualistic]] than [[Social anarchism|social]], some more [[Social anarchism|social]] than [[Individualist anarchism|individualistic]]. However, one cannot conceive of a libertarian who is not an [[individualism|individualist]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html Daniel Guérin Anarchism: From Theory to Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; The position known as [[anarchism without adjectives]] consists on &quot;recognising the right of other tendencies to the name &quot;anarchist&quot; while, obviously, having their own preferences for specific types of anarchist theory and their own arguments why other types are flawed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secA3.html#seca38 A.3 What types of anarchism are there?]. in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The central tendency of anarchism as a mass social movement has been represented by [[anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]], with [[individualist anarchism]] being primarily a [[philosophical anarchism|philosophical or literary phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandre Skirda|Skirda, Alexandre]]. Facing the Enemy: A History of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968. AK Press, 2002, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Some anarchists fundamentally [[non-aggression principle|oppose all forms of aggression]], supporting [[self-defense]] or [[non-violence]] ([[anarcho-pacifism]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence &quot;Resiting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition&quot; by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; while others have supported the use of some [[coercion|coercive]] measures, including violent [[revolution]] and [[terrorism]], on the path to an anarchist society.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R.B. &quot;The Anarchist Tradition of Political Thought.&quot; ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 25, No. 4.

==Etymology and terminology==
{{Related articles|Anarchist terminology}}
The term ''[[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]]'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄναρχος, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;without rulers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy]. [[Merriam-Webster]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]], &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]], &quot;[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]&quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237439].&lt;/ref&gt; from the prefix ἀν- (''an-'', &quot;without&quot;) + ἀρχή (''archê'', &quot;sovereignty, realm, magistracy&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liddell |first=Henry George |coauthors=Scott, Robert |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315894|isbn=0199102058}}&lt;/ref&gt; + -ισμός (''-ismos'', from the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] -ιζειν, ''-izein'' &quot;-izing&quot;). There is some ambiguity with the use of the terms &quot;[[Libertarianism (disambiguation)|libertarianism]]&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; in writings about anarchism. Since the 1890s from France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0900384891 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;libertarianism&quot; has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dean. [http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/politics/name.html ''Who is a Libertarian?''], [[Foundation for Economic Education]], &quot;Ideas on Liberty,&quot; May, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{main|History of anarchism}}
[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Godwin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt;]]
Some claim anarchist themes can be found in the works of [[Taoism|Taoist]] sages [[Laozi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html &quot;Anarchism&quot;], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zhuangzi]]. The latter has been translated, ''&quot;There has been such a thing as letting mankind alone; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [with success],&quot;'' and ''&quot;A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Concepts of the role of intellectuals in social change toward laissez faire|author=[[Murray Rothbard]]|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynic]]s, and their contemporary [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], also introduced similar topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iep|c/cynics.htm|Cynics|Julie Piering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern anarchism, however, sprang from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;&quot;Anarchism&quot;, ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).&lt;/ref&gt; Although by the turn of the 19th century the term &quot;anarchist&quot; had lost its initial negative connotation,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; it first entered the English language in 1642 during the [[English Civil War]] as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]] used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] to damn those who were fomenting disorder.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By the time of the [[French Revolution]] some, such as the ''[[Enragés]]'', began to use the term positively,&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] centralisation of power, seeing &quot;revolutionary government&quot; as [[oxymoron]]ic.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

From this climate [[William Godwin]] developed what many consider the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Tucker]] instead credits [[Josiah Warren]], an American who promoted stateless and [[voluntary community|voluntary communities]] where all goods and services were [[privatization|private]], with being &quot;the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900:1).&lt;/ref&gt; The first to describe himself as an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]],&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006. Hosted by [[Melvyn Bragg]] of the BBC, with John Keane, Professor of Politics at [[University of Westminster]], [[Ruth Kinna]], Senior Lecturer in Politics at [[Loughborough University]], and [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], philosopher and historian.&lt;/ref&gt; a French philosopher and politician, which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movement==
Anarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the 19th century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, &quot;Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters&quot;, in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The First International===
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|left|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion, and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;]]

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |location=New York, N.Y |isbn=0-393-09143-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (sometimes called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blin | first = Arnaud | title = The History of Terrorism | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0520247094 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]].

Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0595249124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |ref=harv | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0710206852 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), Russian revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1980 | isbn = 0710206852 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allied themselves with the [[federalist]] socialist sections of the International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bak | first = Jǹos | title = Liberty and Socialism | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 1991 | isbn = 0847676803 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0810117401 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[centralism|centralist]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-36973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1–55164–251–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organised labour===

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

In response, unions across America prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0691006008 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 |isbn=0691047111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight hour day was made.[[File:50anos.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Spanish propaganda poster from 1932 of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[International Workers' Association]] celebrating &quot;50 years of [[direct action]] against the state and capitalism&quot;]]The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 |isbn=0717806243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on [[May Day]] had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.&lt;ref name=foner&gt;{{cite book | last = Foner | first = Philip Sheldon | title = May day: a short history of the international workers' holiday, 1886-1986 | publisher = International Publishers | location = New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 0717806243 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A.

The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

=== Propaganda of the deed ===
{{Main|Propaganda of the deed}}
[[Image:German anti-communist poster 1918.jpg|left|thumb|Propaganda poster depicting an angel protecting against a bomb-throwing, knife-wielding [[Bolshevik]] activist: propaganda of the deed was widely viewed negatively]]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html &quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, July 25, 1885]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1880s, the slogan &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labor movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favored individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;  &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]’s ‘[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]’ of 1793–94. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]’s imperialist expansion– in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France’s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{cite news |author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July -August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}})  &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement.  For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley's]] assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]. This was in spite of Goldman's disavowal of any association with him, his registered membership in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and never having belonged to an anarchist organization. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after [[World War I]] (1914–18) and the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]]. Important factors towards this include state repression, the level of organization of the labour movement, and the influence of the [[October Revolution]]{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}.

===Russian Revolution===
{{main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)}}
[[Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg|thumb|right|Anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] opposed [[Bolshevik]] consolidation of power following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)]].]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0520072979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]] which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1904859488 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a Western-backed grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin's]] predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist” Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldman | first = Emma | title = [[My Disillusionment in Russia]] |chapter=Preface |page=xx | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 048643270X |quote= My critic further charged me with believing that &quot;had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx&quot; the result would have been different and more satisfactory. I plead guilty to the charge. In truth, I not only believe so; I am certain of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0804702934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the ''[[Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]'',&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supported. [[Platformist]] groups active today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[NEFAC|North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America.

===Fight against fascism===
{{main|anti-fascism|anarchism and nationalism}}{{See also|anarchism in Italy|anarchism in France|anarchism in Spain}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''. August 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. The [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and the movement against the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]] also contributed to the revival of North American anarchism. European anarchism of the late 20th century drew much of its strength from the labour movement, and both have incorporated [[animal rights]] activism. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and anarchist historian [[Andrej Grubacic]] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those &quot;who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits&quot; of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are &quot;much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[ecology|ecological]] and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas&quot;, and who by the turn of the 21st century formed &quot;by far the majority&quot; of anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;[[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]], &quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century]&quot;, [[ZNet]].

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{cite book | page=66 |last = Rupert | first = Mark | title = Globalization and International Political Economy | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 2006 | isbn = 0742529436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police, and the confrontations were selectively portrayed in mainstream media coverage as violent riots. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A landmark struggle of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt;

==Anarchist schools of thought==

[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] thinkers.]]
Anarchist ideas have only occasionally inspired political movements of any size, and &quot;the tradition is mainly one of individual thinkers, but they have produced an important body of theory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian.[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=apstK1qIvvMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Political Ideology Today] p. 115. Manchester University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''.

Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist- and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutualism===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organization emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does “what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0802054587 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton University Press 1996 ISBN 0-69-04494-5, p.6&lt;br /&gt;''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''What Is Property?'' Princeton, MA: Benjamin R. Tucker, 1876. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individualist anarchism===
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the [[anarchist]] movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

[[Image:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|[[19th century philosophy|19th century philosopher]] [[Max Stirner]], usually considered a prominent early [[individualist anarchist]] (sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]).]]
In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson |oclc=2340417 |origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin advocated extreme [[individualism]], proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia''.

Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us &quot;of more worth and importance&quot; than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favoured that is most conducive to the general good.&lt;ref name=pmcl119/&gt; Godwin opposed government because he saw it as infringing on the individual's right to &quot;private judgement&quot; to determine which actions most maximise utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, stripped of utilitarian motivations, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;Paul McLaughlin. Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extreme form of individualist anarchism, called &quot;egoism,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodway, David 2006, p. 99&quot;&gt;Goodway, David. Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow. Liverpool University Press, 2006, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[egoist anarchism]], was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, Max Stirner.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP-Stirner&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|max-stirner|Max Stirner|[[David Leopold]]|2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner's ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.&lt;ref name = &quot;SEP-Stirner&quot; /&gt; According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge.

Blackwell Publishing. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; To Stirner, rights were ''[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]'' in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but &quot;the individuals are its reality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as ''I'' entitle, that is, empower myself to take…&quot; In Ossar, Michael. 1980.

It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and [[LGBT]] activist [[John Henry Mackay]]. Individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner attracted a small following of European bohemian artists and intellectuals (see [[European individualist anarchism]]). Stirner's philosophy has been seen as a precedent of [[existentialism]] with other thinkers like [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]].{{cite}}

===Social anarchism===
{{main|Social anarchism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with public ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens . . . the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot; [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secGint.html Section G - Is individualist anarchism capitalistic? ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality, and emphasises cooperation and [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ostergaard|Ostergaard, Geoffrey]]. &quot;Anarchism&quot;. A Dictionary of Marxist Thought. Blackwell Publishing, 1991. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kropotkin2.jpg|thumb|left|Russian theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921), who was influential in the development of [[anarchist communism]].]]
[[Collectivist anarchism]], also referred to as &quot;revolutionary socialism&quot; or a form of such,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Brian. Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John. Contemporary Socialism. C. Scribner's sons, 1901, Original from Harvard University. p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Johann Most]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot;&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. 2006. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or &quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt; 

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by [[anarchist communists]] as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=The Conquest of Bread |publisher=AK Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |chapter=13 |isbn=9781904859109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0521361826 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&amp;nbsp;– their dictatorship, of course&amp;nbsp;– can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=James Guillaume|last=Guillaume |first=James |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm |title=Ideas on Social Organization |year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarchist communism]] proposes that the freest form of [[social organisation]] would be a society composed of [[self-governance|self-managing]] [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] with collective use of the [[means of production]], organised [[democracy|democratically]], and related to other communes through [[federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;&gt;[[Isaac Puente|Puente, Isaac]].[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html &quot;Libertarian Communism&quot;]. ''The Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review''. Issue 6 Orkney 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; While some anarchist communists favour [[direct democracy]], others feel that its [[majority rule|majoritarianism]] can impede individual liberty and favour [[consensus democracy]] instead. In anarchist communism, as money would be abolished, individuals would not receive direct [[Remuneration|compensation]] for labour (through sharing of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] or payment) but would have free access to the resources and surplus of the commune.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing (1991) ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Graeber|Graeber, David]] and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communism does not always have a [[communitarian]] philosophy. Some forms of anarchist communism are [[egoist anarchism|egoist]] and strongly influenced by radical individualism,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; believing that anarchist communism does not require a communitarian nature at all.

In the early 20th century, [[anarcho-syndicalism]] arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David, ''A History of the French Anarchist Movement'', 1917–1945 p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; With greater focus on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, [[syndicalism]] posits radical [[trade union]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically [[Workers' self-management|self-managed by the workers]]. It is often combined with other branches of anarchism, and anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to [[anarchist communism|anarchist communist]] or [[collectivist anarchist]] [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Iain Mckay |title=[[An Anarchist FAQ]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=2008 |isbn=1902593901 |oclc=182529204|chapter=Are there different types of social anarchism? |url=http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html#seca32}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early leading anarcho-syndicalist thinker was [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose 1938 pamphlet ''Anarchosyndicalism'' outlined a view of the movement's origin, aims and importance to the future of labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html ''Anarchosyndicalism]'' by [[Rudolf Rocker]].

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin, Terry M. ''[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=mppLKlwHx7oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Contemporary+_+Anarchism&amp;ei=vSDBSuXHMo2mM8mu-OsP#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Contemporary Anarchism]''. Transaction Books, New Brunswick, NJ 1979&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcho-capitalism]] developed from radical anti-state [[libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], drawing from [[Austrian School]] economics, study of [[law and economics]] and [[public choice theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Edward Stringham, [http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=53&amp;articleID=686 ''Anarchy, State, and Public Choice''], Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while the burgeoning [[feminism|feminist]] and [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] movements also produced anarchist offshoots. 

[[Anarcha-feminism]] developed as a synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and anarchism that views [[patriarchy]] (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], and [[Dora Marsden]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticise and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender role]]s. [[Green anarchism]] (or eco-anarchism)&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper (1996). [http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=PQOvkB7UoWgC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq= Modern Environmentalism] p. 44.

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change.&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt; It developed &quot;mostly in [[Holland]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt; 

[[Post-left anarchy]] is a tendency which seeks to distance itself from traditional [[left-wing politics]] and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. [[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought drawing from diverse ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomist marxism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[Situationist International|situationism]] and [[postcolonialism]]. 

Another recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is [[insurrectionary anarchism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;joeblack&quot;&gt;[http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html &quot;Anarchism, insurrections and insurrectionalism&quot; by Joe Black]&lt;/ref&gt; which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state; its proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M.

==Topics of interest in anarchist theory==
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
===Free love===
{{main|Free love|Anarchism and sex/love|Anarcha-feminism|Queer anarchism}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|300x300px|French [[individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]] (1872–1962), who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]
An important current within anarchism is [[Free love]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229-50.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|''The Word'']]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;

In New York's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sochen, June. 1972. ''The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910-1920.'' New York: Quadrangle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–98) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''[[Der arme Teufel]]''.

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Emile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf E. Armand and “la camaraderie amoureuse”. Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy]&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In Germany the [[stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]].

More recently, the British [[anarcho-pacifist]] [[Alex Comfort]] gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of [[free love]] has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''The Spanish anarchists: the heroic years, 1868-1936''. AK Press, 1998, p.115. ISBN 187317604X&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.

Another libertarian tradition is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0719066948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p.129&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |month=September/October |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to organizing schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularized by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal issues and debates===
[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|The use of [[anarchism and violence|violence]] is a subject of much dispute in anarchism.]]&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom/&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards [[Issues in anarchism#Race|race]], [[Issues in anarchism#Gender|gender]] and [[Issues in anarchism#The environment|the environment]] have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century.{{cite}}

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Enciclopedy of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].

'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] which considers the [[state (polity)|state]] undesirable, unnecessary and harmful, and instead promotes a stateless society, or [[anarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;

Differing fundamentally, some [[anarchist schools of thought]] support anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;  In the end, for anarchist historian [[Daniel Guerin]] &quot;Some anarchists are more [[Individualistic anarchism|individualistic]] than [[Social anarchism|social]], some more [[Social anarchism|social]] than [[Individualist anarchism|individualistic]].

==Etymology and terminology==
{{Related articles|Anarchist terminology}}
The term ''[[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]]'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄναρχος, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;without rulers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy]. [[Merriam-Webster]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]], &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]], &quot;[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]&quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237439].&lt;/ref&gt; from the prefix ἀν- (''an-'', &quot;without&quot;) + ἀρχή (''archê'', &quot;sovereignty, realm, magistracy&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liddell |first=Henry George |coauthors=Scott, Robert |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315894|isbn=0199102058}}&lt;/ref&gt; + -ισμός (''-ismos'', from the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] -ιζειν, ''-izein'' &quot;-izing&quot;).

[http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/politics/name.html ''Who is a Libertarian?''], [[Foundation for Economic Education]], &quot;Ideas on Liberty,&quot; May, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

Some claim anarchist themes can be found in the works of [[Taoism|Taoist]] sages [[Laozi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html &quot;Anarchism&quot;], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zhuangzi]]. The latter has been translated, ''&quot;There has been such a thing as letting mankind alone; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [with success],&quot;'' and ''&quot;A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Concepts of the role of intellectuals in social change toward laissez faire|author=[[Murray Rothbard]]|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynic]]s, and their contemporary [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], also introduced similar topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iep|c/cynics.htm|Cynics|Julie Piering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern anarchism, however, sprang from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;&quot;Anarchism&quot;, ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).&lt;/ref&gt; Although by the turn of the 19th century the term &quot;anarchist&quot; had lost its initial negative connotation,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; it first entered the English language in 1642 during the [[English Civil War]] as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]] used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] to damn those who were fomenting disorder.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By the time of the [[French Revolution]] some, such as the ''[[Enragés]]'', began to use the term positively,&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] centralisation of power, seeing &quot;revolutionary government&quot; as [[oxymoron]]ic.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

From this climate [[William Godwin]] developed what many consider the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Tucker]] instead credits [[Josiah Warren]], an American who promoted stateless and [[voluntary community|voluntary communities]] where all goods and services were [[privatization|private]], with being &quot;the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900:1).&lt;/ref&gt; The first to describe himself as an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]],&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006. Hosted by [[Melvyn Bragg]] of the BBC, with John Keane, Professor of Politics at [[University of Westminster]], [[Ruth Kinna]], Senior Lecturer in Politics at [[Loughborough University]], and [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], philosopher and historian.&lt;/ref&gt; a French philosopher and politician, which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movement==
Anarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the 19th century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, &quot;Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters&quot;, in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The First International===
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|left|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion, and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;]]

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |location=New York, N.Y |isbn=0-393-09143-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (sometimes called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blin | first = Arnaud | title = The History of Terrorism | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0520247094 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]].

Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0595249124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |ref=harv | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0710206852 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), Russian revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1980 | isbn = 0710206852 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allied themselves with the [[federalist]] socialist sections of the International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bak | first = Jǹos | title = Liberty and Socialism | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 1991 | isbn = 0847676803 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0810117401 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[centralism|centralist]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-36973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1–55164–251–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organised labour===
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchism in Spain|Spanish Revolution}}
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

In response, unions across America prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0691006008 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 |isbn=0691047111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J. Degan |accessdate=2008-01-19 |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 27 June 1886, quoted in {{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=209 |isbn=0691047111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.&lt;ref name='the bomb'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistory.org/dramas/act2/act2.htm |title=Act II: Let Your Tragedy Be Enacted Here |accessdate=2008-01-19 |year=2000 |work=The Dramas of Haymarket |publisher=Chicago Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight hour day was made.[[File:50anos.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Spanish propaganda poster from 1932 of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[International Workers' Association]] celebrating &quot;50 years of [[direct action]] against the state and capitalism&quot;]]The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 |isbn=0717806243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on [[May Day]] had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.&lt;ref name=foner&gt;{{cite book | last = Foner | first = Philip Sheldon | title = May day: a short history of the international workers' holiday, 1886-1986 | publisher = International Publishers | location = New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 0717806243 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A.

The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

=== Propaganda of the deed ===
{{Main|Propaganda of the deed}}
[[Image:German anti-communist poster 1918.jpg|left|thumb|Propaganda poster depicting an angel protecting against a bomb-throwing, knife-wielding [[Bolshevik]] activist: propaganda of the deed was widely viewed negatively]]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html &quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, July 25, 1885]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1880s, the slogan &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labor movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favored individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;  &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]’s ‘[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]’ of 1793–94. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]’s imperialist expansion– in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France’s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{cite news |author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July -August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}})  &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement.  For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley's]] assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]. This was in spite of Goldman's disavowal of any association with him, his registered membership in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and never having belonged to an anarchist organization. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after [[World War I]] (1914–18) and the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]]. Important factors towards this include state repression, the level of organization of the labour movement, and the influence of the [[October Revolution]]{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}.

===Russian Revolution===
{{main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)}}
[[Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg|thumb|right|Anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] opposed [[Bolshevik]] consolidation of power following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)]].]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0520072979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]] which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1904859488 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a Western-backed grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin's]] predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist” Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldman | first = Emma | title = [[My Disillusionment in Russia]] |chapter=Preface |page=xx | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 048643270X |quote= My critic further charged me with believing that &quot;had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx&quot; the result would have been different and more satisfactory. I plead guilty to the charge. In truth, I not only believe so; I am certain of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0804702934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the ''[[Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]'',&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supported. [[Platformist]] groups active today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[NEFAC|North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America. [[Synthesis anarchism]] emerged as an organizational alternative to platformism which tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of [[anarchism without adjectives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;infoshop.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 &quot;J.3.2 What are &quot;synthesis&quot; federations?&quot; in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents [[Volin]] and [[Sebastien Faure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;infoshop.org&quot;/&gt; It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global [[International of Anarchist Federations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;infoshop.org&quot;/&gt;

===Fight against fascism===
{{main|anti-fascism|anarchism and nationalism}}{{See also|anarchism in Italy|anarchism in France|anarchism in Spain}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''. August 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. The [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and the movement against the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]] also contributed to the revival of North American anarchism. European anarchism of the late 20th century drew much of its strength from the labour movement, and both have incorporated [[animal rights]] activism. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and anarchist historian [[Andrej Grubacic]] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those &quot;who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits&quot; of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are &quot;much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[ecology|ecological]] and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas&quot;, and who by the turn of the 21st century formed &quot;by far the majority&quot; of anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;[[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]], &quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century]&quot;, [[ZNet]].

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{cite book | page=66 |last = Rupert | first = Mark | title = Globalization and International Political Economy | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 2006 | isbn = 0742529436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police, and the confrontations were selectively portrayed in mainstream media coverage as violent riots. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A landmark struggle of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt;

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].

==Anarchist schools of thought==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] thinkers.]]
Anarchist ideas have only occasionally inspired political movements of any size, and &quot;the tradition is mainly one of individual thinkers, but they have produced an important body of theory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian.[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=apstK1qIvvMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Political Ideology Today] p. 115. Manchester University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In chronological and theoretical sense there are classical — those created throughout the 19th century — and post-classical anarchist schools — those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]], which embodies the theoretical stance that the [[state (polity)|state]] lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12).

(Mar., 1986), pp. 300-302.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, &quot;necessary evil&quot; but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was &quot;[[anarchism without adjectives]]&quot;, a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the &quot;bitter debates&quot; of anarchist theory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist- and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutualism===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organization emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does “what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0802054587 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton University Press 1996 ISBN 0-69-04494-5, p.6&lt;br /&gt;''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''What Is Property?'' Princeton, MA: Benjamin R. Tucker, 1876. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individualist anarchism===
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the [[anarchist]] movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

[[Image:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|[[19th century philosophy|19th century philosopher]] [[Max Stirner]], usually considered a prominent early [[individualist anarchist]] (sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]).]]
In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us &quot;of more worth and importance&quot; than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favoured that is most conducive to the general good.&lt;ref name=pmcl119/&gt; Godwin opposed government because he saw it as infringing on the individual's right to &quot;private judgement&quot; to determine which actions most maximise utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, stripped of utilitarian motivations, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;Paul McLaughlin. Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extreme form of individualist anarchism, called &quot;egoism,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodway, David 2006, p. 99&quot;&gt;Goodway, David. Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow. Liverpool University Press, 2006, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[egoist anarchism]], was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, Max Stirner.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP-Stirner&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|max-stirner|Max Stirner|[[David Leopold]]|2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner's ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.&lt;ref name = &quot;SEP-Stirner&quot; /&gt; According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge.

Blackwell Publishing. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; To Stirner, rights were ''[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]'' in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but &quot;the individuals are its reality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as ''I'' entitle, that is, empower myself to take…&quot; In Ossar, Michael. 1980.

It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and [[LGBT]] activist [[John Henry Mackay]]. Individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner attracted a small following of European bohemian artists and intellectuals (see [[European individualist anarchism]]). Stirner's philosophy has been seen as a precedent of [[existentialism]] with other thinkers like [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]].{{cite}}

===Social anarchism===
{{main|Social anarchism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with public ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens . . . the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot; [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secGint.html Section G - Is individualist anarchism capitalistic? ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality, and emphasises cooperation and [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ostergaard|Ostergaard, Geoffrey]]. &quot;Anarchism&quot;.

[[Collectivist anarchism]], also referred to as &quot;revolutionary socialism&quot; or a form of such,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Brian. Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John. Contemporary Socialism. C. Scribner's sons, 1901, Original from Harvard University. p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Johann Most]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot;&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005.

[[AK Press]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or &quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt; 

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by [[anarchist communists]] as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=The Conquest of Bread |publisher=AK Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |chapter=13 |isbn=9781904859109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0521361826 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&amp;nbsp;– their dictatorship, of course&amp;nbsp;– can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=James Guillaume|last=Guillaume |first=James |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm |title=Ideas on Social Organization |year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarchist communism]] proposes that the freest form of [[social organisation]] would be a society composed of [[self-governance|self-managing]] [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] with collective use of the [[means of production]], organised [[democracy|democratically]], and related to other communes through [[federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;&gt;[[Isaac Puente|Puente, Isaac]].[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html &quot;Libertarian Communism&quot;]. ''The Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review''. Issue 6 Orkney 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; While some anarchist communists favour [[direct democracy]], others feel that its [[majority rule|majoritarianism]] can impede individual liberty and favour [[consensus democracy]] instead. In anarchist communism, as money would be abolished, individuals would not receive direct [[Remuneration|compensation]] for labour (through sharing of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] or payment) but would have free access to the resources and surplus of the commune.&lt;ref&gt;Miller.

Transaction Books, New Brunswick, NJ 1979&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcho-capitalism]] developed from radical anti-state [[libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], drawing from [[Austrian School]] economics, study of [[law and economics]] and [[public choice theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Edward Stringham, [http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=53&amp;articleID=686 ''Anarchy, State, and Public Choice''], Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while the burgeoning [[feminism|feminist]] and [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] movements also produced anarchist offshoots. 

[[Anarcha-feminism]] developed as a synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and anarchism that views [[patriarchy]] (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], and [[Dora Marsden]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticise and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender role]]s. [[Green anarchism]] (or eco-anarchism)&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper (1996). [http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=PQOvkB7UoWgC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq= Modern Environmentalism] p. 44. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is a school of thought within anarchism which puts an emphasis on environmental issues,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams (2001). [http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=apstK1qIvvMC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq= Political Ideology Today] p. 130. Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and whose main contemporary currents are [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[social ecology]]. [[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change.&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt; It developed &quot;mostly in [[Holland]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt; 

[[Post-left anarchy]] is a tendency which seeks to distance itself from traditional [[left-wing politics]] and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. [[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought drawing from diverse ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomist marxism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[Situationist International|situationism]] and [[postcolonialism]]. 

Another recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is [[insurrectionary anarchism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;joeblack&quot;&gt;[http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html &quot;Anarchism, insurrections and insurrectionalism&quot; by Joe Black]&lt;/ref&gt; which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state; its proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]].

==Topics of interest in anarchist theory==
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
===Free love===
{{main|Free love|Anarchism and sex/love|Anarcha-feminism|Queer anarchism}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|300x300px|French [[individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]] (1872–1962), who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]
An important current within anarchism is [[Free love]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229-50.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|''The Word'']]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;

In New York's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sochen, June. 1972. ''The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910-1920.'' New York: Quadrangle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–98) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''[[Der arme Teufel]]''.

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Emile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf E. Armand and “la camaraderie amoureuse”. Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy]&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In Germany the [[stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]].

More recently, the British [[anarcho-pacifist]] [[Alex Comfort]] gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of [[free love]] has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

===Libertarian education===
[[File:Fransisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]] anarchist pedagogue]][[Max Stirner]] wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it Stirner names his educational principle &quot;personalist,&quot; explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create &quot;free men, sovereign characters,&quot; by which he means &quot;eternal characters...who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html &quot;The False Principle of our Education&quot; by [[Max Stirner]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established &quot;modern&quot; or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |year=1985 |month=Spring/Summer |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: &quot;Por la Verdad y la Justicia&quot; |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–132 |id= |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0018-2680%28198521%2F22%2925%3A1%2F2%3C103%3ATEMMOF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=10.2307/368893 |publisher=History of Education Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to &quot;[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting&quot;. Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in &quot;freedom in education&quot;, education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html Francisco Ferrer's Modern School]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote: &quot;This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''The Spanish anarchists: the heroic years, 1868-1936''. AK Press, 1998, p.115. ISBN 187317604X&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.

Another libertarian tradition is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0719066948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p.129&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |month=September/October |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to organizing schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularized by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal issues and debates===
[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|The use of [[anarchism and violence|violence]] is a subject of much dispute in anarchism.]]&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom/&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards [[Issues in anarchism#Race|race]], [[Issues in anarchism#Gender|gender]] and [[Issues in anarchism#The environment|the environment]] have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century.{{cite}}

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Enciclopedy of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].
